# work-day-schedule

## Description 

    A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events based on the hour that he/she selected based on the common working hours of 9am-5pm. The time will be automatically rendered on the top of the screen for convenience. This application is ran in the browser and will utilize local storage to save text inputs for the calendar. Features HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
